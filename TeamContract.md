# Team Contract (Due Nov 8th)

# Communication

## Team Meetings

We plan on meeting twice a week for around an hour each:
Sundays, 3:00 - 4:00 PM
Tuesdays, 5:00 - 6:00 PM
We will either meet at the Siebel Center for Computer Science for our meetings or meet on Zoom. 
We will take notes individually in our shared folder of what tasks we have finished so far and what tasks we will work on by our next meeting.

## Assistance 
We will communicate through text as we have a group chat between each other for this project. 
We expect to get a response within around two hours if the question is asked during a reasonable hour.

## Respect 
We will give each member a chance to speak at the start of each meeting. 
We will make sure we engage with each member and hear everyone’s thoughts.

# Collaboration

## Work Distribution 

We will assign tasks and keep track of them by creating and assigning issues in Github. 
We can do pair programming for tasks that are difficult or for tasks that two people would like to work on.
#For unexpected complications and unforeseen work, we will meet as a group and figure out the best approaches on how to handle this. Generally, we will try to work it out together and re-prioritize and re-assign tasks and even out the work balance. We will also maintain clear communication with our TA and reach out to them for help and go to Office Hours if we are at a roadblock. 
We will ask about each member’s interests and, based on that, we will assign tasks. If more than one member is interested in a certain aspect, we will make sure that everyone who’s interested as an opportunity to work on and stay involved in that task. 

## Time Commitment: How many hours of work per week is expected of each group member? Are there prior time commitments that need to be accounted for? How will you address new conflicts or commitments when they do inevitably occur?
Aside from our two hourly meetings per week, we expect to work at least two hours each on our tasks each week.
We recognize that we all have busy schedules, so will assign tasks and plan our schedules accordingly.
When new conflicts or commitments occur, we will regroup and talk about if the tasks need to be reassigned or if we should make some weeks chiller than others in terms of how much work we get done for our final project.
## Conflict Resolution: How will the team resolve situations where there is a disagreement between members? Situations where one or more members have not accomplished their tasks? Situations where one or more members are habitually late? Are there other hypothetical situations that you as an individual or as a team want to discuss ahead of time? When issues occur, you are strongly encouraged to inform course staff, but only after first trying to resolve the issue as a team in a respectful manner.
When one or more members of the team haven’t accomplished their tasks, we will have designated extra work sessions, where those who haven’t finished their tasks pick a time and day to work on their tasks. Those who have finished their tasks can choose to come and help out.
If there are habitual problems like timeliness, we will all come together to discuss why this is the case and if there is anything we can do to fix this problem, like change meeting times or locations.
